## Overview
This repository showcases two main workshops so far, each containing its own Arduino project. The workshops build on each other, helping you learn step-by-step. As we progress, we’ll introduce more complex hardware and refined code techniques.

## Workshop 1: Basic Line-Following Car
In **Workshop 1**, we:
- **Built a basic car** that can follow a track using simple sensors.
- **Explored Arduino basics**: pin configurations, wiring, and programming.
- **Learned about circuit design** and how to use essential components (motors, sensors, etc.).

You’ll find:
- A straightforward circuit layout.
- Introductory code to detect and follow a line.
- Notes on troubleshooting common issues (e.g., sensor misreads, motor wiring).

This workshop is ideal if you’re just starting out or want to revisit foundational concepts.

## Workshop 2: Advanced Line Follower with New Chassis & 8-Channel Sensor
In **Workshop 2**, we:
- **Upgraded the hardware** by using a new chassis, N20 motors, and a more robust 8-channel IR sensor array.
- **Refined our PID control** to make the robot’s movements smoother and more accurate.
- **Practiced advanced wiring** with a buck converter, L298N motor driver, and other upgraded components.

You’ll find:
- Detailed code featuring improved PID logic.
- Step-by-step instructions for assembling the new chassis.
- Tips for tuning PID parameters to reduce oscillations and improve speed.

This workshop builds on Workshop 1’s fundamentals, pushing you toward more sophisticated robotics projects.

## Future Plans
- **Additional Workshops:** We plan to explore more features—like adding wireless control (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi), using different sensors (ultrasonic, gyroscope), or incorporating advanced algorithms (adaptive PID, obstacle avoidance).
- **Further Hardware Upgrades:** Expect to see more powerful motors, larger batteries, and custom-designed PCB solutions.

Stay tuned for upcoming updates in the repository’s commits and new workshop folders!
