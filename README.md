## Overview
This repository showcases three main workshops, each containing its own Arduino project. The workshops build on each other, helping you learn step by step. We’ll introduce more complex hardware and refined code techniques as we progress.

## Workshop 1: Basic Line-Following Car
In **Workshop 1**, we:
- **Built a basic car** that can follow a track using simple sensors.
- **Explored Arduino basics**: Understand the basic components, how an Arduino works, and the fundamental principles of a line-following robot (LFR).
- **Learned about circuit design** and how to use essential components (motors, sensors, etc.).

You’ll find:
- A straightforward circuit layout.
- Introductory code to detect and follow a line.
- Notes on troubleshooting common issues (e.g., sensor misreads, motor wiring).

This workshop is ideal if you’re just starting out or want to revisit foundational concepts.

## Workshop 2: Advanced Line Follower with New Chassis & 8-Channel Sensor
In **Workshop 2**, we:
- **Upgraded the hardware** by using a new chassis, N20 motors, and a more robust 8-channel IR sensor array.
- **Enhanced our programming skills** by working with more advanced PID code to control the robot’s movements smoothly and accurately.
- **Practiced advanced wiring** with a LM2596 buck converter, L298N motor driver, and other upgraded components.

You’ll find:
- Detailed code featuring improved PID logic.
- Step-by-step instructions for assembling the new chassis.
- Tips for tuning PID parameters to reduce oscillations and improve speed.

This workshop is aimed at those who want to take their robotics projects to the next level with more precise control and advanced programming.

## Workshop 3: Redesigned Line Follower with TB6612FNG Motor Driver
Introducing **Workshop 3**:
- **New Hardware and Redesign:** This workshop features a completely redesigned line follower built on the Arduino Nano.
- **Enhanced Motor Control:** Utilizes the TB6612FNG motor driver for improved performance.
- **Integrated Communication:** Incorporates a Bluetooth module for wireless control.
- **Updated Assembly:** The circuit is laid out on a vero board for a compact and efficient design, and uses the LM2596 buck converter.

You’ll find:
- A revamped circuit diagram and layout.
- Updated code reflecting the changes in motor driver and communication.
- Comprehensive instructions detailing the assembly and configuration of the Arduino Nano, TB6612FNG motor driver, Bluetooth module, and vero board setup.

This workshop is perfect for those ready to tackle a more refined and feature-rich robotics project.

## Future Plans
- **Additional Workshops:** We plan to explore more features—like adding wireless control (Wi-Fi), using different sensors (ultrasonic, gyroscope), or incorporating advanced algorithms (adaptive PID, obstacle avoidance).
- **Further Hardware Upgrades:** Expect to see more powerful motors, larger batteries, and custom-designed PCB solutions.

Stay tuned for upcoming updates in the repository’s commits and new workshop folders!
